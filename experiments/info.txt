Each separate physical simulation experiment gets its own folder.
Each folder will have a class that extends the Experiment class
to control the overall simulation.

This class should have the GUI info for the experiment in a separate
file (TBDone once I finish my GLFW SVG GUI).

All classes that are a part of an experiment go in the experiment's
folder to keep the main source code folders from becoming too out
if control.

An experiment's directory should look like the following:

../experiments/example/
    exampleExperiment.cpp/.h
    exampleGUI.xml
    src/
        experimentOnlyClass.cpp/.h
        experimentOnlyClass2.cpp/.h
    shader/  <-- experimentOnlyShaders
        vert/
        frag/
        geom/
        comp/
        tesc/
        tese/
    bake/ <-- results of running the experiment and baking the data
        bakedData.data
